# Daily-Selfie-Android-App
Completed for Dr. Porter's Early-2015 Android MOOC

The objective here was to create an app that reminded users to take a selfie. This selfie was to be stored for later viewing in a gallery.

As such, this app aimed to help develop skills in Threads, AsyncTask, Handlers, User Notifications, BroadcastReceivers, Alarms and Data Management.
